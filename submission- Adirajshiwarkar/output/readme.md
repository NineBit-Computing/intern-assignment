# 🤖 Customer Support Ticket Triage using NineBit CIQ SDK

This project is submitted as part of the internship assignment for **NineBit Computing**. It demonstrates the use of the `ninebit-ciq` AI orchestration SDK to automatically analyze, classify, and triage customer support messages using a workflow of LLM-powered agents.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Customer support teams receive thousands of unstructured messages daily. Manually classifying and responding to these is time-consuming and error-prone.

### 🎯 This project automates:
- Message **classification** (Billing, Technical, Account, General)
- **Priority detection** (High, Medium, Low)
- **Response suggestion** using LLMs
- **Information extraction** (e.g., error codes, amounts, keywords)
