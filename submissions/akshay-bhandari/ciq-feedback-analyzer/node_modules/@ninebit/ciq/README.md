## 🚀 Features

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  Perform semantic search and intelligent query answering using hybrid retrieval techniques.
- Flexible Query Interface
  Send queries with configurable similarity thresholds and top_k result tuning.
- Callback Support for Asynchronous Workflows
  Pass in callbacks to handle results or errors once workflows complete — ideal for event-driven applications.
- Workflow Polling with Timeout Control
  Monitor long-running workflows with built-in polling, status checking, and customizable timeouts.
- Simple, Extensible API
  Clean, Pythonic interfaces with support for both synchronous returns and optional callbacks.
- Error-Handled Execution Flow
  Graceful handling of task failures, timeouts, and unexpected states with descriptive exceptions.
- Logging Support
  Integrated logging for easy debugging and transparency during polling or querying.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install @ninebit/ciq
```

## 🔧 Quickstart (Node.js)

```ts
//  Use import for ESM
import { CIQClient } from '@ninebit/ciq';

//  Use require() for CommonJS
const { CIQClient } = require('@ninebit/ciq');

const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY || '';
const client = new CIQClient(apiKey);

async function runExample() {
  try {
    await client.ingestFile('files/eco101.pdf');
    const query = 'Your Query String?';
    const response = await client.ragQuery(query);
    console.log('Query response is ', response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in CIQ:', error);
  }
}

runExample();
```
