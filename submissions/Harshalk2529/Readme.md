HarsNet AI Customer Support Bot 🤖
This repository hosts a prototype of an AI-powered customer support bot for HarsNet, designed to handle common customer inquiries efficiently. Utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and semantic similarity checks, the bot aims to provide accurate answers, learn from human interactions, and continuously improve its knowledge base.

🌟 Features
RAG-based Q&A: Leverages a pre-defined knowledge base of common HarsNet customer support interactions to generate relevant answers.

Semantic Relevance Validation: Employs sentence-transformers to calculate the semantic similarity between the user's query and the bot's generated response. This ensures the answer is contextually relevant.

Human-in-the-Loop Learning: If the bot's answer is deemed irrelevant (based on a configurable similarity score threshold) or if it cannot find an answer, it prompts for human intervention.

Knowledge Base Update: Human-provided corrections or new answers are persistently added to the bot's knowledge base, allowing it to learn and improve with each interaction.

Flexible Output: Designed to output responses as text, with future capabilities planned for audio responses.

Interactive Web Demo: A simple Flask-based web interface allows users to interact with the bot and provide human feedback easily.

🧠 How It Works
The HarsNet bot operates on a core RAG principle combined with a feedback loop:

User Query: A tester asks a question via the web interface.

RAG Query: The Tester question, along with the entire current knowledge base, is fed to the NineBitCIQClient (our RAG model). The RAG model attempts to find the most relevant answer within the provided text.

Semantic Check: The bot then uses a SentenceTransformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to compute the cosine similarity between the original question and the answer returned by the RAG model.

Relevance Decision:

If the similarity score is above a set threshold (e.g., 0.2), the answer is considered relevant and is presented to the user.

If the similarity score is below the threshold, or if the RAG model explicitly states it's "not sure," the system flags the interaction for human review.

Human Feedback & Learning: If human tester help is requested, a prompt appears on the interface for a human agent to provide the correct answer. This human-validated answer, along with the original question, is then persisted (saved to a qa_data.json file in this demo) and integrated into the bot's knowledge base for future use. This allows the bot to "learn" from its mistakes and expand its understanding over time.

🚀 Getting Started
To set up and run the HarsNet AI Customer Support Bot demo locally, follow these steps:

A NineBitCIQ API Key (replace your_api_key in main.py with your actual key).

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Harshalk2529/intern-assignment
cd HarsNet-AI-Bot
Install the required Python packages:

Bash

pip install Flask ninebit-ciq sentence-transformers torch

Running the Application
Set your API Key:
Open main.py and replace "your_api_key" with your actual NineBitCIQ API key:

Python

client = NineBitCIQClient(api_key="YOUR_NINEBIT_CIQ_API_KEY")

Run the Flask application:

Bash

python app.py
Access the bot:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.


This demo showcases the core functionality, but there are areas for significant improvement:

Large Text Chunks: Currently, the entire knowledge base is fed to the RAG model with each query, which is inefficient for very large datasets and may hit token limits.
 
Future Plan: Implement more sophisticated retrieval mechanisms to perform semantic search before feeding relevant chunks to the RAG model, allowing for scalable knowledge bases from diverse data sources (chat logs, audio transcripts converted to text, documentation) and also reply with chat, audio messages as convenience of user.

Future Plan: Integrate Speech-to-Text (STT) for audio input and Text-to-Speech (TTS) for audio responses to create a full audio bot experience.User Interface: Develop a more polished and user-friendly interface.

Note - I tried to implement with large datasets and interaction with audio as well, but text data is getting very much every time and i wasn't able to feed .pdf to RAG to remeber it thus have to feed all data everytime which is making the query-answering time larger with each iteration, also text adding after human inout to running file is not prefferable thus skipped this part for now.
